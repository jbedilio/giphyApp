# giphyApp
The Giphy App is a fun application that accesses giphs of funny celebrity personalities.  Some are provided at the top of the application but there is an input box where the user can enter any celebrity's name and dynamically generate a button to access that personality's most recent 10 giphs.  The application uses JavaScript, JQuery, HTML, CSS, and the giphy api.  https://jbedilio.github.io/giphyApp/
