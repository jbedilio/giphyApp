# giphyApp
The Giphy App is a fun application that accesses giphs of funny celebrity personalities.  Some are pre-provided at the top of the application but there is an input box where the user can enter any celebrity's name and dynamically generate a button to access that personality's most recent 10 giphs.  The application uses JavaScript, JQuery, HTML, CSS, and the giphy api.
